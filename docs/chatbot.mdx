# AI Chatbot 🤖

Ask me anything about the Physical AI and Robotics textbook! I can help you understand concepts, explain code examples, and answer questions about ROS 2, Gazebo, and more.

## Interactive Chat

## How to use

1. **Type your question** in the input box at the bottom
2. **Press Enter or click Send** to submit your question
3. **Wait for the AI response** - it will search the book content and generate an answer
4. **View sources** - each answer includes references to where the information came from

## Tips for better answers

- Be specific about what you want to know
- Reference specific topics like "ROS 2 nodes", "publishers and subscribers", etc.
- Ask follow-up questions to dive deeper
- Select text from the book and ask about it for focused answers

## Need help?

If the chatbot isn't working:
- Make sure the backend server is running on `http://localhost:8000`
- Check that the book content has been indexed in the vector database
- Try refreshing the page
