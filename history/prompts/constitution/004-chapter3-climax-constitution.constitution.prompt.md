## Prompt

Final principles for Chapter 3 - creating the perfect textbook culmination.

Principles:
1. CLIMAX CHAPTER: Make this the most impressive, cutting-edge chapter
2. AI INTEGRATION: Showcase LLM + Robotics convergence
3. CAPSTONE READY: Prepare for final project integration
4. POLISH PERFECTION: Every detail refined
5. DEMO SHOWCASE: Perfect for 90-second hackathon demo
6. FUTURE PROOF: Ready for RAG chatbot integration

## Response snapshot

Successfully updated constitution from v1.1.0 to v1.2.0 with comprehensive Chapter 3 excellence principles:

**Added 5 New Principles (VIII-XII)**:
- VIII. Climax Chapter Excellence: Chapter 3 as showcase, most polished content
- IX. AI-Robotics Convergence: LLM integration with ROS 2, GPT-4 Vision, code generation
- X. Capstone Project Readiness: Integrates all 3 chapters into complete autonomous robot
- XI. Demo Showcase Optimization: 90-second demo script optimized for hackathon judges
- XII. Future-Proof Architecture: Multi-modal RAG, extensible AI service layer

**Added Chapter 3 Requirements**:
- Required Topics: LLM-powered control, vision-language models, AI-assisted development, capstone
- Required Interactive Features: AI code editor, LLM-robot playground, multi-modal chatbot
- Required Examples: 5 complete examples (natural language planning, vision manipulation, code generation)
- Required Exercises: 4 exercises culminating in capstone project

**Development Workflow (13-day plan)**:
- Phase 1: Architecture & Planning (2 days)
- Phase 2: Core AI Integration (3 days)
- Phase 3: Content Creation (3 days)
- Phase 4: Capstone & Demo (2 days)
- Phase 5: Integration & Testing (2 days)
- Phase 6: Documentation & Deployment (1 day)

**Quality Gates**:
- LLM-robot integration must work flawlessly (10 test commands)
- Code generation accuracy validated (5 nodes compile and run)
- Capstone project tested end-to-end
- 90-second demo video recorded and polished
- Visual consistency across all 3 chapters maintained

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Constitution v1.2.0 establishes Chapter 3 as climax chapter with comprehensive AI-robotics convergence principles
- 🧪 Tests: Manual validation - all principles follow constitution template format
- 📁 Files: Updated `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (v1.1.0 → v1.2.0)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Create Chapter 3 specification (`/sp.specify`), Plan Chapter 3 structure (`/sp.plan`)
- 🧠 Reflection: Chapter 3 principles balance ambition (LLM integration, capstone) with pragmatism (13-day timeline, 90-second demo focus)

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - constitution update followed template precisely
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All placeholders filled, version incremented correctly (MINOR bump), sync impact report complete
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A - Standard constitution amendment
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Validate Chapter 3 spec creation follows new constitution principles
